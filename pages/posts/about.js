        ZXY Gallery looks to bring together artists from a variety of
        backgrounds. Inclusivity and safety are primary concerns. We are proud
        to show work from the QTBIPOC, immigrants, women, and other
        communities that have not traditionally had the same opportunities in
        the art world.
        <br /> We also believe that much of the "progress" that has been made
        is a band-aid on a gaping wound. One thing that sets us apart from
        other galleries is our ability to create a safe space for dialogue. As
        such, we have had many artists discuss their work at the gallery.
